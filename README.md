# Tic Tac Toe

Created a front-end tic tac toe game.

Lessons applied in making this game:
- Tic tac toe board in HTML
- Layout with CSS flex box
- Animation with CSS transitions
- Using browserify and babelify to package distributable script
- CI with Travis and deploy to Heroku

Feel free to comment, fork or suggest any improvement.
